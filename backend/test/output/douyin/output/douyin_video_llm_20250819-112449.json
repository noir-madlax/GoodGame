This forces me to adjust my approach and rely on the available information (potentially just the video itself, if accessible) and my understanding of the brand. The \"可能/不确定\" qualification becomes essential.\n\n\n**Inferring Brand Sentiment**\n\nI'm now considering how to generate the `sentiment` field. Lacking direct video access or metadata, my common-sense approach focuses on typical Haidilao Douyin content. Positive sentiment likely stems from Kemusan dances and service stories. Neutral sentiment may relate to restaurant reviews, and negative sentiment would likely involve customer complaints, though without the video's context, this is uncertain. \"可能/不确定\" will be pivotal.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Output**\n\nMy strategy now involves populating the JSON fields. The 'brand' is simple, being '海底捞.' For 'summary,' I'll acknowledge the access limitations and outline potential Haidilao Douyin video themes. I'll carefully address 'sentiment,' and 'key_points,' and identify 'risks,' always using \"可能/不确定\" where appropriate.\n\n\n**Structuring the JSON**\n\nI'm currently refining the JSON output fields.

I'll then address the 'risks' field, focusing on potential downsides.\n\n\n**Generating the Output**\n\nI'm now focusing on formulating the key points and potential risks, always including the crucial \"可能/不确定\" tag. I will ensure these points align with my common-sense understanding of typical Haidilao Douyin content.\n\n\n**Refining Key Points**\n\nI'm now working on the specific \"key\\_points,\" ensuring I use the \"可能/不确定\" qualifier.
