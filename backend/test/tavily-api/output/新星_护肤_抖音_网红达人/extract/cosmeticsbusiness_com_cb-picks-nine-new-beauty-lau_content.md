Singer Dua Lipa has even teamed up with luxury player Augustinus Bader to bring her first skin care line to market.

Sheer colour cosmetics shades are also reining supreme, according to launches from both Estée Lauder and NARS, while French MUA Violette Serrat is leaning into maximalism with the latest multi-dimensional launch from her brand Violette_FR.
