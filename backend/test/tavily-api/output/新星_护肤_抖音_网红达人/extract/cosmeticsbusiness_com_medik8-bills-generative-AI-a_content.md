Medik8 is utilising 3D AI ‘Digital Twin’ technology to significantly cut down the time it takes to create content. Here’s why the science-backed, L’Oréal-owned skin care brand believes in the future of artificial intelligence

[Medik8](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/l-or%C3%A9al-snaps-up-majority-stake-in-medik8), the [L'Oréal](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/lor%C3%A9al-opens-first-dedicated-shop-in-shop-Africa)-owned skin care brand, has been levelling up its marketing through the use of [artificial intelligence](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/l-or%C3%A9al-is-fueling-the-future-of-ai) (AI) to create images and videos for its marketing campaigns.

The science-backed business has been using the 3D AI ‘Digital Twin’ technology, in partnership with design studio [Omi](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/l-or%C3%A9al-teams-up-with-omi-to-create-3d-gen-ai-brand-imagery), which creates an exact copy of every item in its product skin care range.

Medik8’s in-house design team can then generate images and videos of the item in different locations, backdrops and lighting.

This significantly slashes the time it takes for the brand’s marketing team to create content, cutting down what could take weeks of work into something that can be turned around on the same day.

And time is more necessary than ever, as Robyn Walker, Global Head of Creative at Medik8, told _Cosmetics Business_ that the brand “urgently needed to increase the scale and speed at which we produce content”.
