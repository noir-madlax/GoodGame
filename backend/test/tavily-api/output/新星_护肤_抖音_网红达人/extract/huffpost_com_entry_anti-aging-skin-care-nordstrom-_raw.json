Plus, 1% zinc helps to support a balanced complexion by regulating excess sebum activity.\n\n**Promising review:**“I’m 49 years old, and last summer I started using The Ordinary Niacinimide and Hyaluronic Acid serums. They work so well together, and my face looks and feels healthy again! I have had to replace my used up bottles twice now. This is the real deal, and worth more than its weight in gold! Thank you The Ordinary for making my skin happy again without breaking the bank.

The formulation contains a 6.5% retinoid blend, a relatively high percentage compared with other retinol products on the market.\n\nThe blend is composed of a retinoid ester, encapsulated retinol and retinol-alternative extracts derived from blue-green algae, all of which can impart the texture-improving wonders that retinol is known for, without overwhelming the skin and causing irritation. Additionally, an antioxidant known as COQ10 targets the appearance of sun damage while two different humectants soothe redness and draw moisture into the skin.\n\nAfter using this product consistently for two months, Flores noticed a significant reduction of keratosis pilaris, a smoother texture, less redness and fewer clogged hair follicles. She also noticed less congestion in her T-zone, fewer sun freckles and an overall increase in skin plumpness — all without those telltale signs of retinol-induced irritation.\n\n[$85+ at Nordstrom](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fa-high-dose-retinoid-serum%2F5326896)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7\n\n[Open Image Modal](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmurad-rapid-dark-spot-correcting-serum%2F5790777)\n\nNordstrom\n\nA famously powerful dark spot correcting serum\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**Rating:**4.3 out of 5 stars and 69 reviews\n\n[Murad's Rapid Dark Spot correcting serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmurad-rapid-dark-spot-correcting-serum%2F5790777) is a true powerhouse. For those of us with hyperpigmentation and dark spots, powerful actives like glycolic acid can make a big difference in overall appearance. In addition to featuring glycolic acid, this correcting treatment also contains a skin-evening complex that's exclusive to the brand and tranexamic acid, a trendy ingredient that we've been [previously told](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-tranexamic-acid-txa_l_6215170ee4b0afc668b7290c) by dermatologists is excellent for lightening dark spots, reducing hyperpigmentation and lessening the appearance of acne scars.\n\n**Promising review**: “I received a small tube of this with a GWP. It is a gel like serum that applies easily to the skin. I have slightly sensitive skin and did not find this product at all irritating to my skin. I can't say it reduced any dark spots but only using a small tube maybe I ned longer. It does however leave your skin noticeably brighter even after first use.

It absorbs quickly, leaving skin hydrated without any oily residue or heaviness.\n\n**Promising review**: “I find some oils have a heavy feel, leaving me smelling like a roast chicken, but this overnight recovery oil is different!

It has a higher SPF than the previous formulation and is infused with hydrating algae and licorice root extract that can help soothe acne-prone skin. Its lightweight, fluid formula is designed to prevent a white cast and have a silky smooth, weightless finish. It's great for a busy and active day at the beach or pool. For decades, this was my seemingly ageless grandmother's SPF of choice, and I'm a new convert thanks to this wonderful ingredient upgrade. It's not cheap, but it's such a perfectly balanced product that I'm surprised it doesn't cost more.\n\n**Promising reviews:**“One of my favorite products. I've used this spf lotion for years now.

It’s packed with powerful proprietary ingredients like the complex, nutrient-rich [TFC8](https://go.linkby.com/FOHTJOQH/us/en/evidence/the-science-of-tfc8), and the brand has conducted a slew of [clinical trials](https://go.linkby.com/FOHTJOQH/us/en/evidence/user-and-clinical-trials) that show convincing physical evidence of its products’ effectiveness. It's a science-forward cream that is rich with luxurious and effective botanicals, antioxidants and fatty acids that drench the skin in moisture and skin-loving ingredients, making it worth every penny.\n\n**Promising review:**“The texture is luxurious, rich without being greasy, and it absorbs beautifully. I use it at night and wake up with skin that looks like I've had 10 hours of sleep (even when I haven’t!). What makes it even more impressive is how it calms redness and helps heal dry patches — I’ve even noticed old acne scars fading. Yes, it's an investment — but the formula is so potent and concentrated that a little goes a long way.
