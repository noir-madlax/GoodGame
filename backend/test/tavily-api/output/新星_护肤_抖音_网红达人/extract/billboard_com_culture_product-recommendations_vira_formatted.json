Justin Bieber uses a gua sha to keep himself looking good, and so does his wife, Hailey.

Lymphatic drainage is just a fancy way of saying you’re moving extra fluid from a swollen area into an area where the lymph nodes will work to drain said fluid. The emphasis on stainless steel is because it is non-porous, meaning it won’t harbor bacteria or moisture like plastic would.\n\n![20 Viral Gifts to Buy for the Holidays in 2025](https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif)\n\n### KPop Demon Hunters HUNTR/X Officially Licensed T-Shirt\n\nA T-shirt featuring all of the HUNTR/X members on the front.\n\nJust like the Saja Boys, HUNTR/X also made it big this year with the viral sensation that was, and is, *KPop Demon Hunters*.
