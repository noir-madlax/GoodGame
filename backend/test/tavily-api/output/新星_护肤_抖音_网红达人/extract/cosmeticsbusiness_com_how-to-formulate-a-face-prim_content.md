[Face primer formulas](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/grip-primers-can-the-latest-launches-unstick-e-l-f-s) are an essential item for long wearing make-up.

If your cosmetic brand sells [foundation](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/sculpted-by-aimee-unveils-cushion-foundation), then a primer formula that helps extend the wear life of that foundation is a fantastic addition.

Face primers have trended so strongly in recent years that their form can vary significantly from simple (see the essential [ingredients](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/tag/ingredients), below), to more advanced multifunctional formulas to combat oil, pore size, hydration and colour balancing.
