# Augustinus Bader partners with Dua Lipa for singer’s debut beauty brand

The skin care range launches with Lipa’s ‘everyday essentials’, comprising a Balancing Cream Cleanser, Supercharged Glow Complex, and Renewal Cream powered by Augustinus Bader science

Grammy Award-winning singer [Dua Lipa](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/ysl-beauty-dua-lipa-global-make-up-ambassador) has broken into the beauty industry with an eponymous skin care brand, created in collaboration with [Augustinus Bader](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/augustinus-bader-unveils-futuristic-pop-up-by-harry).

The three-strong DUA Skincare collection has been formulated with patented TFC5, a proprietary technology designed to promote the skin barrier and improve elasticity.

TFC5 was created as a new version of the skin care brand’s TFC8 but intended for younger skin.

“I created this skin care line to be my everyday essential – a skin care routine that is clean, effective, and effortless,” said founder Lipa.

“It was incredibly important to me to work with a team that values the use of clean formulas and high-quality ingredients, and I knew I could trust Augustinus Bader to help bring this to life based on their attention to detail and the level of importance they place on the science that goes into each product.

“My hope is that these become your daily essentials too – at home, on the go, and everywhere in between.”

The initial launch comprises a Balancing Cream Cleanser, Supercharged Glow Complex, and Renewal Cream.

The Balancing Cream Cleanser is a cream-to-foam cleanser that is designed to gently remove make-up, SPF, oil, and buildup without stripping for skin.

It works to clear pores, balance oil levels, and refine skin texture.

The Supercharged Glow Complex, meanwhile, is a multi-functional complex that has been formulated to visibly fade post-acne marks and dark spots and enhance elasticity.

It also smooths the appearance of fine lines and helps prevent damage from daily stressors.

The collection is rounded off with the Renewal Cream that provides hydration and improves elasticity while reinforcing the skin barrier and health.

Charles Rosier, co-founder and CEO of Augustinus Bader, added: “The DUA Collection represents the perfect fusion of science and creative force.

“I am thrilled to make our proprietary TFC technology accessible to an even wider community.

“Brought to life through our collaboration with Dua, TFC5 pushes the boundaries of what modern skincare can achieve.”

While this is Lipa’s first beauty brand, the singer has held several ambassador roles over the years.

[YSL Beauty](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/ysl-beauty-taps-may-december-star-charles-melton) has appointed Lipa as Global Make-up Ambassador in 2024 in a bid to ramp up its make-up reach.

Lipa also invested in London-based hair care brand [Dizziak](https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/company/single_company/Dizziak/148700) in 2022, which creates hydrating products for every hair type.
