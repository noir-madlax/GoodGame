Staying on top of your skin’s health has more benefits than just aesthetic ones. Nurtured [skin](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/holy-grail-beauty-skin-care-ud_l_6837c1b0e4b06202aa90ddb0) can better protect itself against environmental stressors and damage, and even heal faster. So while [beauty](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-beauty-products-huffpicks-awards-2025_l_6835c678e4b0b885650d3eed) products aimed at mature skin with the “[anti-aging](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/skin-serums-ud_l_68d7102ae4b085d511c6a917) label” are often controversial, it really is just a catch-all term for products with active ingredients that can help to improve the overall health and appearance of your skin.

From serums to creams, SPF and beyond, there’s no end to the various products that can give your skin (and self esteem) a bit of a boost. Nordstrom has a beautifully curated collection of anti-aging skin care products, featuring popular brands at a wide range of price points. Below, we’ve rounded up some of the best options to shop, including editor beloved items, some HuffPost reader-faves and some tempting luxury products that are worth the splurge.

A renowned night serum with over 22,000 ratings
-----------------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.5 out of 5 stars and 21,971 reviews

Some products are reliable and timeless, like [Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Repair serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fadvanced-night-repair-synchronized-multi-recovery-complex-serum-with-hyaluronic-acid-peptides%2F5700327). It has more than earned its legions of devoted fans, with one reviewer stating she's "used this for decades." It uses peptides, antioxidants and nourishing, hydrating ingredients that can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles while hydrating, strengthening and evening out skin. It's fast acting and won't let you down.

**Promising review:**“I ordered a small size of this night repair to see if it was worth the money for a larger size. Yes, it is going to be worth a larger size. No breakouts, skin is more even, and pores are smaller. Never tried a night repair before, I really like it.” – [B 75](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fadvanced-night-repair-synchronized-multi-recovery-complex-serum-with-hyaluronic-acid-peptides%2F5700327)

A K-beauty vitamin C serum reviewers call "magic in a freaking bottle"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.5 out of 5 stars and 15 reviews

This K-beauty [serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkorean-skincare-day-glow-vitamin-c-serum%2F7861740) combines the potency of 20% vitamin C with ferulic acid to further enhance the effectiveness of the star ingredient. The addition of hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin and gives you a stunning glow.

**Promising review:**“This serum is so much better than its competitors! It’s lightweight and is easily absorbed into my skin. The light orange scent is amazing. It has all sorts of wonderful ingredients and it really helps to make my skin glow. Don’t waste hundreds of dollars when you can get this for such a bargain.” — [DesMB](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkorean-skincare-day-glow-vitamin-c-serum%2F7861740)

A cult-fave daily facial moisturizer
------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.7 out of 5 stars and 3,572 reviews

If you're ready to invest in a truly hydrating and luxurious day cream, this is it. The [Pro-Collagen Marine cream](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fpro-collagen-marine-cream%2F2889488) is a long-time fan favorite, and with good reason. It's designed to be incredibly soothing and adept at quenching dehydrated skin, while also delivering a hefty dose of anti-aging ingredients that can help to firm skin and smooth fine lines and wrinkles. It has a satin finish and a soft texture that won't weigh you down.

**Promising review:**“I've used this lovely Elemis product for 20 years. A 21 yo remarked this week that my skin is beautiful. I'll take that!” — [CP Osborne](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fpro-collagen-marine-cream%2F2889488)

A nourishing serum that can help with redness and skin texture
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.4 out of 5 stars and 2,306 reviews

[The Ordinary's niacinamide serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fniacinamide-10-zinc-1-serum-for-oily-skin%2F5489311) is one of the internet's most well-known formulations and a product that HuffPost Shopping writer [Tessa Flores](https://www.huffpost.com/author/tessa-flores) has [used and loved for several years](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-ordinary-is-affordable-skincare-amazon_l_67bc9e5ce4b05645f4feec6d). A primer on [niacinamide](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-niacinimide_l_60d9d297e4b0b9db24990abe): It's a ubiquitous, do-it-all ingredient that can accomplish everything from managing redness to improving irregular skin texture. This formula is affordable and utilizes a high-strength niacinamide concentration to effectively brighten a dull skin tone and reduce the appearance of blemishes. Plus, 1% zinc helps to support a balanced complexion by regulating excess sebum activity.

**Promising review:**“I’m 49 years old, and last summer I started using The Ordinary Niacinimide and Hyaluronic Acid serums. They work so well together, and my face looks and feels healthy again! I have had to replace my used up bottles twice now. This is the real deal, and worth more than its weight in gold! Thank you The Ordinary for making my skin happy again without breaking the bank. Let’s face it, everything is expensive now, and I didn’t have to sacrifice my skincare when we cut out all the “extras” from our budget.” — [Jennilea_the_salty_siren](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fniacinamide-10-zinc-1-serum-for-oily-skin%2F5489311)

A popular German hand cream
---------------------------

**Rating:**4.5 out of 5 stars and 15 reviews

This simple [German hand cream](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fgehwol-hand-cream%2F5022533) is highly rated at retailers like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GEHWOL-Hand-Cream-2-6-Oz/dp/B0858XX99Q?tag=lourdesuribe-20&ascsubtag=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035%2C-1%2C-1%2Camp%2C0%2C0%2Chp-fil-am%3D0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0) and Nordstrom thanks to it's deeply moisturizing, quick-aborbing cream that won't leave your hands feeling like an oil-slick. Reviewers report that it's great for dry, chapped hands thanks to anti-inflammatory ingredients like bisabolol and panthenol that are nourishing and can help promote healing, while clotrimazole, an anti-fungal ingredient and other antimicrobial actives can help keep infections at bay.

[One reviewer at Nordstrom](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fgehwol-hand-cream%2F5022533) said, "It instead quietly heals your hands with a faint fresh scent, sinking in immediately. I was skeptical at first. How could something so non-greasy do better than my beloved Weleda Skin Food? Well, let me tell you. With a nickel sized application before bed, my hands have stayed soft, and have not cracked and bled once this winter for the first time in my life. I now use this year-round."

The retinoid serum that overhauled our senior shopping writer’s skin
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rating**: 4.7 out of 5 stars and 959 reviews

[Sunday Riley’s A+ retinol serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fa-high-dose-retinoid-serum%2F5326896) is an advanced-strength retinoid that is suitable for both individuals with sensitive skin and experienced users of the ingredient. The formulation contains a 6.5% retinoid blend, a relatively high percentage compared with other retinol products on the market.

The blend is composed of a retinoid ester, encapsulated retinol and retinol-alternative extracts derived from blue-green algae, all of which can impart the texture-improving wonders that retinol is known for, without overwhelming the skin and causing irritation. Additionally, an antioxidant known as COQ10 targets the appearance of sun damage while two different humectants soothe redness and draw moisture into the skin.

After using this product consistently for two months, Flores noticed a significant reduction of keratosis pilaris, a smoother texture, less redness and fewer clogged hair follicles. She also noticed less congestion in her T-zone, fewer sun freckles and an overall increase in skin plumpness — all without those telltale signs of retinol-induced irritation.

A famously powerful dark spot correcting serum
----------------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.3 out of 5 stars and 69 reviews

[Murad's Rapid Dark Spot correcting serum](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmurad-rapid-dark-spot-correcting-serum%2F5790777) is a true powerhouse. For those of us with hyperpigmentation and dark spots, powerful actives like glycolic acid can make a big difference in overall appearance. In addition to featuring glycolic acid, this correcting treatment also contains a skin-evening complex that's exclusive to the brand and tranexamic acid, a trendy ingredient that we've been [previously told](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-tranexamic-acid-txa_l_6215170ee4b0afc668b7290c) by dermatologists is excellent for lightening dark spots, reducing hyperpigmentation and lessening the appearance of acne scars.

**Promising review**: “I received a small tube of this with a GWP. It is a gel like serum that applies easily to the skin. I have slightly sensitive skin and did not find this product at all irritating to my skin. I can't say it reduced any dark spots but only using a small tube maybe I ned longer. It does however leave your skin noticeably brighter even after first use. Not too keen on the smell but otherwise good.” — [Gems8111](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmurad-rapid-dark-spot-correcting-serum%2F5790777)

A tried-and-true replenishing serum by Kiehl's
----------------------------------------------

**Rating**: 4.5 out of 5 stars and 3,487 reviews

Wake up bright-eyed with this [nourishing face oil](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkiehls-midnight-recovery-concentrate%2F3088002)that can help restore the look of skin while you sleep. It's formulated with active botanical ingredients that can help to reduce fine lines, improve skin texture and give your skin a radiant, youthful appearance. I've used this serum on and off for years, and constantly find myself going back to it because it just feels so good and works so well. It absorbs quickly, leaving skin hydrated without any oily residue or heaviness.

**Promising review**: “I find some oils have a heavy feel, leaving me smelling like a roast chicken, but this overnight recovery oil is different! Gorgeous light, botanical smell and better result - even though my skin is combination it leaves skin soft and glowing. Would definitely recommend.” — [Cloveslotions](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkiehls-midnight-recovery-concentrate%2F3088002)

A powerful exfoliating treatment
--------------------------------

**Rating:**4.5 out of 5 stars and 1,648 reviews

This effective [exfoliating treatment](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkate-somerville-exfolikate-intensive-exfoliating-treatment%2F3065423) uses the power of chemical, physical and enzymatic exfoliation to soften, smoothe and brighten skin. Think of it as a mask, scrub and peel in one. It is great for people who have both acne and breakouts, and while it's pricey, a little goes a long way. Use it a few times a week for a fresh skin reset that makes a big impact.

**Promising review:**“I’ve been using this twice a week and my skin feels amazing! This is more than I usually spend on skincare but totally worth it. I’m back now to buy the larger tube.” —‚ [JSBoston](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fkate-somerville-exfolikate-intensive-exfoliating-treatment%2F3065423)

A majorly luxurious body cream
------------------------------

**Rating:**4.6 out of 5 stars and 248 reviews

If you love [Charlotte Tilbury's Magic face cream](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-magic-cream-face-moisturizer-with-hyaluronic-acid%2F6296851), you're going to become obsessed with the brand's [body cream](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmagic-body-cream%2F7460202). It uses a combination of hydrating, firming and smoothing ingredients that can leave your skin looking and feeling young, fresh and silky. I've been using it in the summer for years and love how soft and supple it leaves my leg skin. It's a quick and easy way to get movie-star legs without feeling greasy or heavy. 

**Promising review:**“I have been used this product for about 3 weeks now and I am sure I notice a difference. It doesn’t smell too much which I like as I find some body creams overpowering. I’m a side sleeper and I do have vertical lines at my décolleté which I feel self conscious about but this cream is helping.” — [Fragrant lover](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmagic-body-cream%2F7460202)

A gorgeous and silky smooth SPF
-------------------------------

**Rating:**4.7 out of 5 stars and 412 reviews

Recently, Shiseido updated its [cult-fave sun lotion](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fshiseido-ultimate-sun-protector-lotion-spf-60-sunscreen%2F7709286) to greater effect. It has a higher SPF than the previous formulation and is infused with hydrating algae and licorice root extract that can help soothe acne-prone skin. Its lightweight, fluid formula is designed to prevent a white cast and have a silky smooth, weightless finish. It's great for a busy and active day at the beach or pool. For decades, this was my seemingly ageless grandmother's SPF of choice, and I'm a new convert thanks to this wonderful ingredient upgrade. It's not cheap, but it's such a perfectly balanced product that I'm surprised it doesn't cost more.

**Promising reviews:**“One of my favorite products. I've used this spf lotion for years now. It's lightweight, doesn't leave my face oily and a little goes a long way.” — [June](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fshiseido-ultimate-sun-protector-lotion-spf-60-sunscreen%2F7709286)

A Jenna Lyons-beloved moisturizer
---------------------------------

**Ratings:**4.2 out of 5 stars and 1,4284

This pricey [celebrity-beloved moisturizer](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fthe-rich-cream%2F5891504) starts at a cool $98 a bottle (for the smallest travel size), but that hasn’t stopped dedicated beauty lovers from getting their hands on it. It’s packed with powerful proprietary ingredients like the complex, nutrient-rich [TFC8](https://go.linkby.com/FOHTJOQH/us/en/evidence/the-science-of-tfc8), and the brand has conducted a slew of [clinical trials](https://go.linkby.com/FOHTJOQH/us/en/evidence/user-and-clinical-trials) that show convincing physical evidence of its products’ effectiveness. It's a science-forward cream that is rich with luxurious and effective botanicals, antioxidants and fatty acids that drench the skin in moisture and skin-loving ingredients, making it worth every penny.

**Promising review:**“The texture is luxurious, rich without being greasy, and it absorbs beautifully. I use it at night and wake up with skin that looks like I've had 10 hours of sleep (even when I haven’t!). What makes it even more impressive is how it calms redness and helps heal dry patches — I’ve even noticed old acne scars fading. Yes, it's an investment — but the formula is so potent and concentrated that a little goes a long way. Plus, it layers well with other products, and doesn't pill under makeup, which is a huge bonus for me.” — [Faith hh](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fthe-rich-cream%2F5891504)

A highly-rated at-home peel system
----------------------------------

**Rating**: 4.7 out of 5 stars and 118 reviews

One of the easiest-to-use methods of chemical exfoliation involves these daily peels from Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. Each treatment contains two pads: one to exfoliate and smooth your skin, and one that provides anti-aging benefits. The pads are pre-dosed with five acids, including glycolic, salicylic and lactic, that each work to reduce dullness and uneven texture, pores and hyperpigmentation.

"These [peels] are super effective and contain both alpha and beta hydroxy acids for maximum results," [Dr. Lindsey Zubritksy](https://www.instagram.com/dermguru/?hl=en), a Mississippi-based board-certified dermatologist, told HuffPost in [previous reporting.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-exfoliation-products_l_628fcba7e4b0b1d984533007)

**Promising review:**“I was introduced to these peels during the anniversary sale 5 years ago and I have not stopped using them. I love their 2 step system and the product is extremely effective. My skin glows, is smoother, and clearer and I love the texture. Can be strong if used twice a day but just change to 3 days a week and then increase to the level you're comfortable with. Easy to pack for travel for maintaining an excellent skincare ritual.” — [AdrianaNarz](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fdr-dennis-gross-skincare-alpha-beta-peel-original-formula-30-applications%2F2847983)

A wildly luxurious facial serum
-------------------------------

**Rating:**4.5 out of 5 stars and 231 reviews

This Eighth Day serum has a hefty price tag, but take into consideration the fact that [this one bottle](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fregenerative-serum%2F7320977) has the potential replace all other skin care serums for the entirety of a year. This serum was specially developed by a dermatological surgeon and has a super-high concentration of peptide-rich plasma and active ingredients that sink into the skin and can help to reduce visible signs of aging like fine lines, firmness, large pores, dryness, hyperpigmentation and uneven texture.

**Promising review:**“I’ve never had immediate results from a skincare product - ever! My skin is glowing and feels tightened and tuned around my eyes. And it’s so lightweight .. unbelievable. I’m hooked! Nice job finding this amazing product for me Nordstrom :)” — [WorkinggirlSF](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fregenerative-serum%2F7320977)

A moisturizing face oil that won't clog pores
---------------------------------------------

**Rating:**4.3 out of 5 stars and 939 reviews

I've been using [this oil](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fclear-pure-radiance-oil%2F5850664)for years, reaching for it any time my skin needs a bit of extra hydration and love. Made with a whopping 27 plant actives like nutrient-rich and potent calendula oils, cucumber seed oil, organic hemp and jojoba seed oils and fresh ginger root oil, it’s a hydrating, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic dream. It’s no wonder that famously beautiful celebs like [Laura Dern](https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-anti-aging-beauty-products/slide22), [Lizzo](https://www.instyle.com/beauty/skin/lizzo-skincare-true-botanicals), [Brooke Shields](https://www.instyle.com/beauty/brooke-shields-true-botanicals-anti-aging-renew-pure-radiance-oil-4579605), [Olivia Wilde](https://www.wellandgood.com/olivia-wilde-true-botanicals-routine/) and [January Jones](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/january-jones-beauty-skincare-products_n_5bad4b7ae4b09d41eb9fdd1b) are huge fans of the brand in general, and this oil specifically.

I’ll admit that I was initially put off by the $110 price tag, but quickly came to see it as a valuable investment in my skin’s health. All you need are 3-4 drops per application, so a single bottle can be stretched out for months at a time.

**Promising review**: “I’ve been using this oil nightly for a year now and it has been a game changer for my skin. Not only is my skin clear and healthy looking (finally- now at 40 yrs old) but it’s made it much more hydrated. I used to wake up with very dry skin every day but not since using this. Now that I’m taking the “less is more” approach, just a gentle cleanser and this oil is all I use and my skin is the best it’s ever been. I tell everyone to get this oil.” — [Lauren](https://nordstrom.sjv.io/c/2706071/1960196/23920?subId1=6903c065e4b00c26f070b035&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fclear-pure-radiance-oil%2F5850664)
